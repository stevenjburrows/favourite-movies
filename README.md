# Lumina Learning Ltd - Graduate Software Developer Assignment
We kindly ask you to solve the task below. By solving and submitting this assignment you provide us with insights in how you solve real-world problems. What we will be looking at are topics such as: choice of technology, structuring of code, selection of 3rd party libraries, documentation etc.


## The task
- Build a service with PHP or JavaScript (NodeJs as webserver) as the server side language
- Use MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, SQL Server or SQLite as the database

Build an SPA (Single Page Application) that shows everyone's favourite movies from database, it should at least show movie Title, Poster, and Plot synopsis using [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com) or any other public movie API that supports IMDb ID (e.g. tt8526872)

It should also be able to add or remove list of favourite movies.

Please use the data set provided in the SQL dump in this repo as a base.
You can change original asset that you think will make the solution better.
You are allowed to use any library or framework to help you with the task.

## Bonus task
You are not required to complete all of the bonus tasks, but great if you do! We may want to discuss your approach to the bonus tasks during interview so please think of your approach to these challenges even if you do not complete them.

- Use client side framework such as AngularJS, Angular, ReactJS, Vue, etc.
- Add simple authentication for any user (or all users) and only authenticated user could view or edit their favourite movies. You could adjust the database structure if needed.
- Add unit tests
- Serve your solution somewhere on cloud hosting solution e.g. Heroku, DigitalOcean, etc. (just use the free tier one if available, we don't expect you to spend any money for hosting)
- Any other improvement or modification (please add it into the readme and explain your reasoning of the improvement or modification)

## Expectations
Make a copy of this repo. Solve the task. Push your code to a public repo, and send us the link as a reply to our email.

Your solution should include a short readme describing your assumptions regarding the task, technology choice, your solution, how to use/test it and any final considerations such as known errors, limitation, something you struggle with, next steps, security concerns etc.
