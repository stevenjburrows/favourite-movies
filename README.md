## The task
- Build a service with PHP or JavaScript (NodeJs as webserver) as the server side language
- Use MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, SQL Server or SQLite as the database

Build a single page to show everyone's favourite movies from database, it should at least show movie Title, Poster, and Plot synopsis using [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com) or any other public movie API that supports IMDb ID (e.g. tt8526872)
